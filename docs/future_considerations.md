## Future-Proofing the Architecture

1. **Modular Data Pipeline**  
   - The existing design uses **Airflow** for orchestration, **dbt** for transformations, and **BigQuery** for scalable storage.  
   - Keep each layer (Bronze/Raw, Silver/Refined, Gold/Mart) flexible so that data ingestion or transformations can change independently if data volume surges or new data sources appear.
   - **Containerization** of Airflow and dbt processes can ensure consistent deployments and enable scaling on platforms like Kubernetes.

2. **Partitioning & Clustering**  
   - In BigQuery, partition by date (e.g., ticket creation date) or cluster by category/agent to maintain query performance as data grows.  
   - This ensures the pipeline remains cost-effective and performant under higher query loads.

3. **Data Governance & Security**  
   - Use fine-grained access control (column-level or row-level security if necessary) to handle sensitive data (e.g., personally identifiable information).  
   - Document transformations and maintain a data dictionary to reduce confusion and maintain compliance.

4. **High Availability & Disaster Recovery**  
   - Multi-region replication or backups in GCS can shield the pipeline from localized outages.  
   - Testing restore processes regularly ensures rapid recovery if an incident occurs.

## Potential Integration of Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics

1. **Use Cases**  
   - **Predictive Quality Scoring**: Leverage historical ratings to forecast which tickets are likely to receive poor scores (e.g., by analyzing text from conversation transcripts).  
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Use ML (e.g., logistic regression or transformer-based models) for fine-grained sentiment classification on ticket content.

2. **Model Development & Deployment**  
   - **Containerization**: Package ML models and their dependencies in Docker images for consistent deployment.  
   - **Kubernetes**: Deploy model inference services that auto-scale based on real-time load.  
   - **Integration**: Pipeline can feed data from the Silver or Gold layers into ML training, while predictions can be written back to a dedicated prediction table in the Mart layer.

3. **Flexibility & Portability**  
   - A self-managed container-based ML approach avoids vendor lock-in and can be migrated across clouds or on-premises.  
   - Evaluate managed offerings (Vertex AI, Amazon Sagemaker) for convenience vs. self-hosted solutions for maximum control.

4. **Continuous Improvement**  
   - **CI/CD for ML**: Automate retraining (e.g., weekly or monthly) as new tickets and reviews arrive, ensuring the model stays updated with the latest data.  
   - **Monitoring & Alerting**: Track key performance metrics (accuracy, F1, recall) and detect concept drift over time.
